# UltraRedFreedomMod #

UltraRedFreedomMod (URFM for short) is a edited version of TFM, Made by the one-and-only, PacksGamingHD. We have coded custom ranks and custom commands. You are not allowed to compile URFM without PacksGamingHD's permission. 

History of URF & URFM
URFM has loads of versions, it all started back in 2014, when UltraRedFreedom was created by RedEastWood. The first mod was created by ItsBearMC. It wasnt that good to be honest. It had millions of errors. There are currently 10 versions of the mod. The developers that have contributed the most are _xXTheOpXx_ and _Nobody_. They, however, are no longer a part of URF Staff team. The new Lead Developer is PacksGamingHD. We also, had a FreedomOpRemasteredMod, but the mod was removed for various technical reasons.

We are now using URFM v10 by PacksGamingHD
